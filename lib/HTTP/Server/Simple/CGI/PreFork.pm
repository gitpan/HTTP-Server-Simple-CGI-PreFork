=head1 NAME

HTTP::Server::Simple::CGI::PreFork - Turn HSS into a preforking webserver and enable SSL

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Are you using HTTP::Server::Simple::CGI (or are you planning to)? But you want to handle multiple
connections at once and even try out this SSL thingy everyone is using these days?

Fear not, the (brilliant) HTTP::Server::Simple::CGI is easy to extend and this (only modestly well-designed)
module does it for you.

HTTP::Server::Simple::CGI::PreFork should be fully IPv6 compliant.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a plugin module for the "Commands" module and handles
PostgreSQL admin commands scheduled from the WebGUI.

=head1 Configuration

Obviously, you want to read the HTTP::Server::Simple documentation for the bulk
of configuration options. Since we also overload the base tcp connection class
with Net::Server, you might also want to read the documentation for that.

We use two Net::Server classes, depending on if we are preforking or single
threaded:

Net::Server::Single for singlethreaded

Net::Server::PreFork for multithreaded

In addition to the HTTP::Server::Simple configuration,
there are only two additional options (in the hash to) the
run() method: usessl and prefork.

=head2 prefork

Basic usage:

$myserver->run(prefork => 1):

Per default, prefork is turned off (e.g. server runs singlethreaded). This
is very usefull for debugging and backward compatibility.

Beware when forking: Keep in mind how database and filehandles behave. Normally,
you should set up everything before the run method (cache files, load confiugurations,...),
then close all handles and run(). Then, depending on your site setup, either open a
database connection for every request and close it again, or (and this is the better
performing option) open a database handle at every request you don't have an open handle yet -
since we are forking, every thread get's its own unique handle while not constantly opening and
closing the handles.

Optionally, you can also add all the different options of Net::Server::Prefork like "max_servers" on
the call to run() to optimize your configuration.

=head2 usessl

Caution: SSL support is experimental at best. I got this to work with a lot of warnings,
sometimes it might not work at all. If you use this, please send patches!

Set this option to 1 if you want to use SSL (default is off). For SSL to actually work, need
to add some extra options (required for the underlying Net::Server classes, something like this
usually does the trick:

$webserver->run(usessl => 1,
                proto => 'ssleay',
                "--SSL_key_file"=> 'mysite.key',
                "--SSL_cert_file"=>'mysite.crt',
                );


=head2 run

Internal functions that overrides the HTTP::Server::Simple::CGI run function. Just as explained above.

=head1 IPv6

This module overrides also the pure IPv4 handling of HTTP::Server::Simple::CGI and turns
it into an IPv4/IPv6 multimode server.

Only caveat here is, that you need the Net::Server modules in version 2.0
or higher. If you still use Net::Server 0.99.6.*, you should install
HTTP::Server::Simple::CGI::PreFork 1.2 from BackPan. 

Net::Server version 0.99 and lower only supports IPv4.

=head1 Possible incompatibilities with your computer

Older versions of HSSC::Prefork did not automatically require the IPv6 modules on installation.
This behaviour has changed, starting at version 2.0. This is in accordance with with RFC6540, titled
"IPv6 Support Required for All IP-Capable Nodes". If you don't have an IPv6 address, thats OK (or more
precisely *your* problem). But the software now assumes that your system is technicaly capable of handling 
IPv6 connections, even if you don't have an IPv6 uplink at the moment.

Doing it this way simplifies many future tasks. Anyway, if your system is old enough to be incapable of
handling IPv6... according to RFC6540 you are not connected to what is nowadays defined as "the internet".


=head1 QUICK-HACK-WARNING

This module "patches" HTTP::Server::Simple by overloading one
of the functions. Updating HTTP::Server::Simple *might* break
something. While this is not very likely, make sure to test
updates before updating a production system!
